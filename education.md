- [Good Research Code Handbook][good_research_code_handbook] by Patrick Mineault

### Unix

Unix will be how you navigate the Terminal and access data on Biowulf. If you aren't already familiar with Unix, check out any of these tutorials to begin familiarizing yourself with it.

- [HPC/Biowulf Bash Course][hpc_bash]
- [Software Carpentry: The Unix Shell][swc_shell]

We use Git and GitHub for version control to manage our work and collaborate across the lab.

### Neuroanatomy

- [Marian Diamond's anatomy course on Youtube][Diamond_class] This is all anatomy, not just the brain, but her brain lectures within the class are a good introduction
- [The Human Brain Coloring Book][Diamond_book] by Marian Diamond & Arnold Scheibel. They believe that tracing paths and regions is key to learning. This is also the clearest neuroanatomy book for someone who doesn't already know most of neuroanatomy. SFIM has some copies, but can also buy for individuals who want to color (or buy yourself, if you might want to keep it)

### Neurovascular Coupling

- Hillman et al "Coupling Mechanism and Significance of the BOLD Signal: A Status Report" Annual Review of Neuroscience 2014 [DOI:10.1146/annurev-neuro-071013-014111](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-neuro-071013-014111)
- Handwerker et al "The continuing challenge of understanding and modeling hemodynamic variation in fMRI" NeuroImage 2012 [DOI:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.02.015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.02.015)

- [DartBrains][dartbrains]: Dartmouth course (created by Luke Chang) geared towards analyzing fMRI data in Python.

### Books

Some of these books are available online and others we might have hard copies. Ask lab members for access.

- Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging by Huettel, Song, & McCarthy (designed for undergrad introductory courses and probably the best survey of all relevant topics for someone new to neuroimaging with MRI)
- [The Basics of MRI, Joseph P. Hornak][basics_mri] (intro to MRI physics basics)
- Introduction to Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging by Richard Buxton (good intro to contrasts beyond BOLD, but last edition was 2010, before VASO and other contrasts got big)
- Principles of Magnetic Resonance Imaging by Liang & Lauterbur (more physics and signal processing perspective)
- Magnetic Resonance Imaging by Dwight Nishimura (electrical engineering / signal processing perspective)
- MRI: The Basics by Hashemi, Bradley, & Lisanti (designed for radiologists to help them understand contrasts without advanced physics)
