# Section on Functional Imaging Methods

A website for hosting useful resources for members of the [Section on Functional Imaging Methods](https://fim.nimh.nih.gov).

## Lab Policies and NIH Information

- [Data and Code Policy][lab_policy]: As part of our Data Management and Sharing plan (and federal policy), we have committed to making our data and code publicly available. This page lists specific details about how we implement this.
- [Supporting Distressed Co-Workers][supporting_coworkers]: As a lab, we hope to be able to support each other to encourage a safe and positive work environment. This page provides resources for well-being, in addition to critical links and phone numbers for critical resources at the NIH.
- [Respiratory Virus Guidance](https://ors.od.nih.gov/sr/dohs/safety/NIH-respiratory-virus-guidance/Pages/default.aspx): Central page on responses and policies regarding respiratory viruses (formerly the COVID guidance page). Overall, if someone is being more cautious than you, respect that. If you are more cautious than others and are asked to be in situations where you don't feel comfortable, speak up.

## Education

In our [Education][education] page, we have compiled a list of resources to learn more about topics that might be useful for working in SFIM. This includes resources on programming, MRI and neuroscience in general. For NIH-specific educational offerings, check out the [NIH Training Office][training_office] website.

## How-tos

Here, we provide guides for how we recommend doing things in the lab. If you prefer to do things differently and think that your workflow might work well in the lab, let us know and we can integrate the information here.
