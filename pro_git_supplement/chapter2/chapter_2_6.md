### Undoing Things

#### Questions for Understanding
- Do tags update with a branch?
- Can lightweight tags have messages?
- Are tags automatically synchronized with remotes?
- When checking out a specific tag, what type of state are you in?
  What's one way to get out of it?

#### Exercises
- On the recipes repository, tag the very first commit as "v0.0"
- Check out the tag "v0.0" and then add another commit.
  Then, return from the detached HEAD state by checkout out `main`.
