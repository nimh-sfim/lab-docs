# Helpful Tips

## Generate a .tsv file
For things like BIDS, you may need to generate a .tsv file.
We recommend the following procedure:
1. Create your file in Excel
1. Go to File -> Save As -> Tab-delimited text (\*.txt).
1. Accept that there will be potential information loss (note: this means
   you can't use things like formulas)
1. Rename your `.txt` file to a `.tsv` file, with either your operating
   system's renaming function or with
   ```
   mv file.txt file.tsv
   ```
