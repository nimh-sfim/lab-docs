## Neuroanatomy

- [Marian Diamond's anatomy course on Youtube][Diamond_class] This is all anatomy, not just the brain, but her brain lectures within the class are a good introduction
- [The Human Brain Coloring Book][Diamond_book] by Marian Diamond & Arnold Scheibel. They believe that tracing paths and regions is key to learning. This is also the clearest neuroanatomy book for someone who doesn't already know most of neuroanatomy. SFIM has some copies, but can also buy for individuals who want to color (or buy yourself, if you might want to keep it)
