# Software Recommendations

We have (highly subjective) recommendations for the following categories of
software:
- [Text Editors](#Text-Editors)
- [Programming Packages](#Programming-Packages)
- [Scientific Software](#Scientific-Software)
- [Communication Platforms](#Communication-Platforms)

## Text Editors
- For people who prefer to have graphical interfaces, or who work with
  various rich text formats, we recommend [Visual Studio Code][vscode].
- For people who are kind of command savvy, but would still like a graphical
  interface, and don't work with a lot of markup text, we recommend
  [Sublime][sublime].
- For the people who love the command line and inhabit it, Josh recommends
  vim (installed on MacOS and Linux by default),
  which is better than emacs (installed on MacOS and Linux by default)
  because Josh said so.

  **NOTE**
  
  Dan actually prefers emacs 4ever, but he is wrong.

## Programming Packages
- [miniconda3][mc3] is the preferred way of managing your python
  environments.
  Back in our day, we had to manage our own environments.
  We do *not* recommend it.
- For those who want an IDE that isn't purely comamnd line, we recommend
  [PyCharm][pyc] for Python development.

## Scientific Software
- We do most of our image processing with [AFNI][afni], because they're real
  swell folks who write good programs.
  They are also just down the hall and they're watching us.
- We present subjects in the scanner with stimulus through [PsychoPy][pp].

## Communication Platforms
- We use [Slack][slack], because apparently we enjoy watching a gargantuan
  program devour our RAM.
- We also use Microsoft Teams, because the NIH gives it to us for free.
  If you're an NIH employee or fellow, it should come on your laptop.
  Bonus: it integrates into our calendars!
  Calendar integration is essential for those of us who are organizational
  disasters.
  We try not to point fingers at who those people are, but mostly it's Josh.
  Josh is the organizational disaster.
